Attrition is the departure of employees from the organization for any reason (voluntary or involuntary), including resignation, termination, death or retirement.
In this project I have used IBM's attrition dataset (available at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pavansubhasht/ibm-hr-analytics-attrition-dataset) 
to visualize how different factors have an impact on attrition and use the insights gained to train a XGBClassifier to predict if an employ will leave the company.
